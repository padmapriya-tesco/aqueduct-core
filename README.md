Delivers data to specific network locations in an efficient, secure and near real-time manner.

Note this is currently a work in progress product, and we wouldn't recommend using it in production yet. We intend to open source other related components and documentation in the near future.

## Objectives

1. Reduce network traffic usage by delivering data to location groups only once in most cases
2. Optimise the time taken to deliver data to a location
3. Throttle traffic not to impact the network
4. Only data required by the location is routed to it

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
1. Java 1.8+
2. Groovy 2.5.4+
3. Gradle 5.4.1+

### Setting up IntelliJ
1. Clone the project from git into a local folder (eg /code/aqueduct-pipe)
2. File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources
3. Select your folder (eg /code/aqueduct-pipe)
4. Import project from external model -> Gradle -> Next
5. &lt;Leave Default Settings&gt; -> Finish
6. Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner
   1. Delegate IDE build/run actions to Gradle: &lt;Checked&gt;
   2. Run tests using: Gradle Test Runner
 
 ## Tests
 _./gradlew test integration_

###Issue: 
When running tests, you receive the following error:

######Solution:

Delete the sub-folder of embedded-pg. 
```
rm -rf /var/folders/my/02z_ghk12h54_k9lrm8vhq8m0000gn/T/embedded-pg/PG-d6f2320465793366f452337868c0d06f
